Why don't you stay here ?
I like #.
It's like nothing matters.
Would you have taken me ?
I can't be your guide.
It's alright. Cheer up!
You look happy. 
Hold on for a minute.
Roses aren't that red.
Others wld hve run away.
I want to leave.
I will never live here.
I live here.
# is nt for vryone.
I like your name.
I hope things work out.
Take me with you :(
<The creature looks sad>
...
...#...#...
# drives me mad
Could you inhabit here ?
I've left regret behind.
I regret every decision.
Never say goodbye.
Did you ever see truth ?
I'm having troubles.
I cannot breathe.
<The kid looks worried>
I may be lost.
Hope you'll find your way
Where's the way out ?
It's been hours already.
Those hours flt lke days.
I'm startng to feel hngry
Run while you can!
Explore, explore!
This place is mysterious
There's something hidden
I'm feeling observed...
Where did I bury it ?
Where's my happiness ?
I'm looking for love.
I like your enthusiasm.
Keep going!
Enjoy it while it lasts.
You look tired...
Everything's all right ?
Do you hate trees ?!
You're hurting Nature!
I feel wrecked.
Day 4, still no sleep.
Help me. I need help.
Any food yet ?
Anythng interstng yet ?
I won't look back.
